This boiler plate based on course available at : https://codereviewvideos.com/course/fosuser-fosrest-lexikjwt-user-login-registration-api

RESTful user Registration and Login system using a combination of:

* FOSUserBundle
* FOSRESTBundle
* LexikJWTBundle

Custom configuration security for auth route.

Speaking of this, we will need to ensure our RESTful user login and registration system is well tested. For this we will make use of Behat, writing a full suite of tests to cover the various flows:

* Login
* Password Management
* Registration
